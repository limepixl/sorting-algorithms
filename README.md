# sorting-algorithms
Sorting algorithms visualized using SFML / C++.

Yes, these visualizers are plentiful on here but I wanted to give them a shot by doing one from scratch.

This project is a sort of 'intro to SFML' for me, so the code is messy, inefficient and probably could be changed and abstracted far more to make it on par with other visualizers out there.

If anyone wants to contribute by fixing any mistakes or improving upon anything in this project, feel free to open a pull request!
